      <h3>The Tale of Froggy and Kwak</h3>

    <div class="text-bg-success">
        Froggy, an adorable frog, saw Kwak, a majestic royal monkey sitting at the top of the palace. Froggy
        thought to themself, "damn, that's one furry monkey. I've never seen such glamorous fur before." Coming
        from the swamps, Froggy had only felt the slime and slickness of crocodiles. This changed everything, so Froggy jumped 
        up to the top of the palace, but miscalculated the jump. Froggy ended up on top of the roof, screaming for help
        from Kwak.

    <!-- TEXT TRUNCATION -->
    <span class="d-inline-block text-truncate" style="max-width: 50%;">
    <!-- the documentation said this would only work with display:block or display:inline-block. we opted for the example with display:inline-block as we thought this would be more applicable to our work -->
        Stay tuned... To be continued...
    <!-- d-inline-block is the bootstrap shortcut to set display:inline-block. the style specifies where the text should be cut off. the ellipses are added automatically-->
      <!-- this would have been very helpful with our K00 projects when we only wanted to show a snippet of our blogs/stories -->

    <!-- classic type of button that gets lighter when you hover over it -->
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-success" disabled>Primary button</button>
    <!-- btn-success creates a green button with white text. it does not change color because the user is prohibited from clicking on the button -->
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-info btn-lg">Large button</button>
    <!-- btn-info creates a large blue button with white text. it becomes a lighter shade of blue once hovered over -->
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary">Primary</button>
    <!-- btn-outline-primary creates a blue outline of the button with blue text. once hovered over, the button's background becomes blue and the text becomes white -->

    <br> <br>

    <div class="d-grid gap-5">
      <!-- d-grid makes the button the length of the screen. gap-5 specifies the distance between the two buttons. 5 is the maximum so any number beyond it makes the two buttons touch. -->
      <button class="btn btn-dark" type="button">Button</button>
      <button class="btn btn-dark" type="button">Button</button>
      <!-- the button spans the entire screen and is black with white text. when hovered over, the button turns gray -->
