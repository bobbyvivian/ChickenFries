DISCO:
 * render_template is a function that takes in, as arguments, a file path relative to templates and as many parameters as you want. The parameters are then replaced in the html file
 * You can pass in your own arguments into a function by writing each argument's name and it's value, separated by an equals sign
 * render_template returns a string
 * In an HTML template, you can put variables to be replaced by putting their name between {{ }}
 * You can write for loops in Jinja by writing {% for item in collection %} and {% endfor %} and placing the content of the loop in between

QCC:
 * What if you place a non-HTML file into Jinja? (We were too lazy to try this out)
 * What it you want your HTML file to contain double squirrely brackets to display on the webpage? How would you write this without it getting interpreted as Jinja syntax
