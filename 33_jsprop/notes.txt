DISCO/QCC:
* boolean arg in .addEventListener('click', clicky, false/true);
always prioritizes true, and if the arg is true, then it follows the events that are true, and then in the order of highest parent first,
and if it's false then it follows the regular order of the lowest/youngest child first (going up the branches of heredity)
* without the boolean arg, whichever element is the farthest down the line of children pops up first-->then we go up the branches of the DOM Tree
