Q0: Removing render_template will make it so that you can't access the template folder and it would result in an error

Q1: 127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template

Q2: model_tmplt.html is the html template we want to yoink
foo is a variable representing the title of the webpage, so if we set it so a string "fooooo", the title will become that string.
collection is also a variable in the html template we replace with coll.
